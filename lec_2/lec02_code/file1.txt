The simple "text file" is one of the oldest and simplest types of file. For that reason, text files are one of the most universally standard ways to store information. 
A text file is something you could type up in a word processor, and save with the "plain text" option. 
A text file is made of a sequence of characters, organized as a series of horizontal lines of text.
There is no notion of bold or italic or color applied to the characters; they are just plain text characters, as we would store in a String.
Historically, text files have been made of the familiar roman keyboard alphabet – abcdef..xyz012..89!@#$.. – with the extremely standard ASCII encoding (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).
More recently, text has grown to include the idea of unicode characters like ø and !, but the encodings for those are not yet as standard as ASCII.
The.java files where we write our Java code are examples of text files. 
The text file is such a simple, flexible way to store information, it will be with us for a long time to come. 
If you want to store information in a simple, non-proprietary way, the text file is a great choice.XML files, which are a very modern way to store information,are a type of text file.
