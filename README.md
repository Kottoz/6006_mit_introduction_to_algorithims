### why do we use ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\fn_phv&space;\log_{2}{n})  in algorithims analysis ?
 You might expect that this is because computers represent numbers in binary, but usually that is not why, 
 ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\fn_phv&space;\log_{2}{n})  is (with suitable rounding)   the number of times you can divide n by 2 before reaching 1
